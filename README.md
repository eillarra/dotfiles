.dotfiles
---------
This is how I personalize my system.
In a fresh installation, I just need to clone this repo and run the `install` command:

    $ cd
    $ git clone https://github.com/eillarra/dotfiles .dotfiles
    $ sh .dotfiles/install.sh

Updates
-------
The following command should run most of the critical updates:

    $ update
